# 👋 Hi, I’m Lilla O'Connor

## Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm passionate about various aspects of technology, fitness, wine, and our planet. Here's a bit more about me:

- 👀 **Interests**: I'm fascinated by everything computer-based, enjoy exploring new technologies, love running, and hold a WSET Level 3 certification in wine. I'm also deeply interested in environmental sustainability and the mysteries of the universe.

- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: I'm on a journey to master Data Science, with a focus on Python programming and Machine Learning. Additionally, I'm actively training for an Ultra Marathon, always pushing my limits both mentally and physically.

- 💞️ **Collaboration**: I'm open to collaborating on exciting and innovative projects. Whether it's coding, analysing data, or contributing to a sustainable initiative, count me in!

- 📫 **Contact**: Want to connect or collaborate? Feel free to drop me an email at [lilla.o@outlook.com](mailto:lilla.o@outlook.com). I'm always eager to chat with and learn from fellow enthusiasts and professionals.

- 😄 **Pronouns**: (optional!) 

- ⚡ **Fun Fact**: Did you know that bananas are naturally slightly radioactive due to their potassium content? Don't worry, though; you'd need to eat thousands of bananas in a short amount of time for it to have any noticeable effect on your health!

Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out. Let's create something awesome together!
